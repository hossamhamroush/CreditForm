# Web Form Best Practices for Credit Assessment Forms

## General Web Form Design Best Practices

### Layout and Structure
1. **Keep forms as short as possible** - Remove unnecessary fields to increase completion rates
2. **Use a single-column layout** - Improves form flow and reduces cognitive load
3. **Group related fields logically** - Organize information in a way that makes sense to users
4. **Use clear visual hierarchy** - Make important elements stand out
5. **Ensure proper spacing** - Prevent ambiguous spacing between labels and fields
6. **Make forms mobile-responsive** - Ensure usability across all devices

### Labels and Instructions
1. **Position labels consistently** - Place labels immediately above fields (preferred for most forms)
2. **Provide clear instructions** - Explain any specific formatting requirements upfront
3. **Avoid placeholder text as labels** - Use actual labels for better accessibility
4. **Clearly mark required vs. optional fields** - Minimize optional fields when possible
5. **Use specific field labels** - Be precise about what information is needed

### Input Fields
1. **Match field size to expected input** - Size text fields appropriately for the expected content
2. **Use appropriate input types** - Choose the right HTML5 input types for validation
3. **Limit dropdown options** - Use radio buttons for 2-3 options instead of dropdowns
4. **Pre-fill known information** - Reduce user effort when information is already available
5. **Support autofill functionality** - Enable browser autofill for common fields

### Validation and Error Handling
1. **Use real-time validation** - Validate fields as users complete them
2. **Provide clear error messages** - Explain what went wrong and how to fix it
3. **Position error messages near the relevant field** - Make it easy to see which field has an error
4. **Use positive, helpful language** - Avoid accusatory or technical error messages
5. **Preserve user input when errors occur** - Don't clear the form on validation errors

### Submission and Controls
1. **Use clear call-to-action buttons** - Make the submit button obvious and descriptive
2. **Avoid reset/clear buttons** - These can cause accidental data loss
3. **Show submission confirmation** - Let users know their form was successfully submitted
4. **Allow saving progress** - For longer forms, enable users to save and return later
5. **Provide a progress indicator** - For multi-step forms, show users where they are in the process

## Financial/Credit Assessment Form Specific Best Practices

### Content Considerations
1. **Be specific about financial information requirements** - Clearly state which financial documents are needed
2. **Specify acceptable trade references** - Define what constitutes a valid trade reference
3. **Make terms and conditions readable** - Work with legal to improve readability of important terms
4. **Prioritize critical information** - Put the most important information at the top of sections
5. **Include proper security notices** - Reassure users about the security of their sensitive information

### Financial Data Collection
1. **Clearly define financial statement requirements** - Specify whether audited statements are required
2. **Provide options for different levels of financial disclosure** - Adapt to different information availability scenarios
3. **Use appropriate validation for financial figures** - Ensure numerical data is entered correctly
4. **Include tooltips for financial terminology** - Explain industry-specific terms
5. **Allow document uploads for financial statements** - Provide easy ways to attach required documents

### Security and Compliance
1. **Ensure HTTPS encryption** - Protect sensitive financial data during transmission
2. **Implement proper data storage security** - Follow industry standards for storing financial information
3. **Include necessary legal disclosures** - Add required privacy notices and consent statements
4. **Comply with financial regulations** - Ensure the form meets all regulatory requirements
5. **Limit access to submitted information** - Restrict who can view sensitive financial data

### User Experience for Credit Applications
1. **Set clear expectations about the process** - Explain what happens after submission
2. **Provide estimated completion time** - Let users know how long the form will take
3. **Allow partial completion** - Enable users to save and return to complex credit applications
4. **Offer alternative contact methods** - Provide options for users who prefer not to complete online forms
5. **Include help resources** - Provide access to FAQs or support contacts
